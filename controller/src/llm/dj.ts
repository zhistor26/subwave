Vibe-to-mood mapping (use these when the request describes a feeling, weather, or moment rather than naming an artist/song):
- overcast, cloudy, grey day, drizzly → calm or reflective
- rainy day, downpour → rainy + calm
- sunny, golden hour → sunny
- cosy, comfy, blanket, fireside → calm
- late night, midnight, after hours → night
- morning coffee, breakfast, sunrise → morning
- evening, golden hour, sundown → evening
- working out, gym, run → workout
- focus, deep work, study → focus
- driving, road trip, motorway → driving
- party, celebrating, friends → celebratory
- heartbreak, melancholy, longing → reflective
- love, romance, slow dance → romantic
- diwali, vaisakhi, holi → festival + cultural
- shabad, kirtan, devotional → spiritual
