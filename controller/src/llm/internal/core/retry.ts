// Hard wall-clock ceiling on a single agent generation (including its

// honoured by every transport — ai-sdk-ollama ignores it, so a
// reasoning-locked cloud model that never reaches the tool call just runs
// until its output budget is spent (observed at 60s+ per pick on
// minimax-m2.7:cloud while the caller believed it was capped at 22s). The
// race here is the guarantee; the AbortSignal is passed through as well so
// transports that DO support cancellation stop the request server-side
// instead of leaving it burning an inference slot.
//
// The deadline error deliberately does NOT look host-unreachable (its name
// matches neither isUnreachable's name checks nor its message regex): a model
// that overthinks past the deadline is not a host that's down, so the call
// must fall back to the caller's stateless path, not fail over to the backup
// leg on a different model.
