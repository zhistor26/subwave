// The shared "right now" context block + narrative-variety helpers. Used by
// every generate* script, by matchRequest, and by the segment director
// (skills/_agent.js) — so they all show the model the same picture of the moment.

// Narrative angles per call type. One is picked at random and injected into the
// user prompt as "Tone for this segment:" so consecutive generations don't fall
// back to the same shape. Only the generate* callers consume these — the segment
// director gets its variety from its CAPABILITIES descriptions. Add freely — the
// more variety here, the less the DJ repeats itself.
