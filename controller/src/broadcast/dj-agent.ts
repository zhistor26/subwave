// Session DJ agent — the conversational brain that runs over a stream session.
//
// The system posts events into the session ("a track started, pick the next
// one"; "a listener requested X"); this module hands the session chat window
// to a tool-loop agent that explores the library and decides. Its output (the
// chosen track, an optional spoken link/intro) is enqueued and appended back
// to the session as turns, so the next event sees what the DJ just did.
//
// The conversational path is gated on `settings.llm.pickerAgent`. When it is
// off — or when the agent fails for any reason — this falls back to the
// stateless pool picker (music/picker.js) and the stateless link generator
// (llm/dj.js), so a pick is never missed. Either way the session is updated.
