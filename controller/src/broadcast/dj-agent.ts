// Session DJ agent — the conversational brain that runs over a stream session.
//
// The system posts events into the session ("a track started, pick the next
// one"; "a listener requested X"); this module hands the session chat window
// to a tool-loop agent that explores the library and decides. Its output (the
// chosen track, an optional spoken link/intro) is enqueued and appended back
// to the session as turns, so the next event sees what the DJ just did.
//
// The conversational path is gated on `settings.llm.pickerAgent`. When it is
// off — or when the agent fails for any reason — this falls back to the
// stateless pool picker (music/picker.js) and the stateless link generator
// (llm/dj.js), so a pick is never missed. Either way the session is updated.

// --- Feature 4: DJ-mode mini-runs ------------------------------------------
// A short, deliberate tempo/key journey across 2-3 consecutive picks. While a
// run is active the pool re-rank is anchored to the run target (not just the
// current track), and the link patter acknowledges the run. State is module-
// level — one station, one run at a time. Cleared when it runs out or when the
// active persona isn't in DJ mode.
//
// Phase 2 overlay — a SONIC JOURNEY. When the audio (CLAP) index is populated,
// a run can also carry a sequence of waypoint vectors through the audio space
// toward a destination vibe; each pick consumes one waypoint, handed to the
// picker as the audio-KNN anchor so the pool drifts toward the destination
// while the tempo/key re-rank still applies. `waypoints`/`step` are absent on a
// plain tempo/key run (no audio index, or the journey couldn't be built), in
