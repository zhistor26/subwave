// Frequency gate for the scheduler's station-ident crons.

// cadence (every quarter-hour / every hour); this function decides whether a
// given tick may fire under the frequency of the effective persona (the
// scheduled show's owner this hour, or the active persona) — quiet | moderate
// | aggressive.
//
// Between-track segments (weather, news, traffic, facts, web search) are NOT
// gated here — the segment-director agent (skills/_agent.js) owns its own
// frequency floor. Lives outside scheduler.js to keep that file lean.
