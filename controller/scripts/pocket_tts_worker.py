PocketTTS worker — line-protocol child process.

The Node side (controller/src/audio/pocketTts.ts) spawns this once and keeps
it alive: kyutai-labs/pocket-tts loads a ~100M-param model on first call and
caching it across requests turns ~6x real-time inference into the actual cost
per line. Protocol mirrors kokoro_worker.py and chatterbox_worker.py — one
JSON object per line over stdin/stdout.

Request:  {"id": "...", "text": "...", "voice": "alba",
           "reference_wav": "/path/to/ref.wav",  # optional, empty = built-in
           "out": "/path/to.wav"}
Response: {"id": "...", "ok": true,  "path": "/path/to.wav", "duration_s": 3.4}
       |  {"id": "...", "ok": false, "error": "..."}

Voice selection (issue #213):
  - "voice" only (built-in id like alba, anna, charles, estelle, giovanni,
    juergen, lola, rafael) → curated voice plays directly.
  - "reference_wav" set     → zero-shot cloning from the WAV. The base voice
    is still passed so the model has a speaker prior if the reference load
    fails — the worker logs the failure and falls back instead of erroring.

The model is bundled into the controller image only when it is built with
`--build-arg WITH_POCKETTTS=1` (see docker/Dockerfile.controller). Weights live
under the Hugging Face cache (HF_HOME), pre-warmed at image build time.
