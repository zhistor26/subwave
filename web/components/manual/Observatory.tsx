          The Observatory lives at <code className="bs-code-inline">/observatory</code>, reachable from the
          Observatory link in the admin nav. It reads the same tagged library the{' '}
          <Link href="/manual/admin" className="bs-link">admin console</Link> manages, so it sits behind the
          same sign-in: enter your admin credentials once and it opens straight to the map.
        </p>
        <p>
          A track only appears once the DJ has tagged it with a mood and energy (see{' '}
          <Link href="/manual/dj" className="bs-link">How the DJ Works</Link>). A fresh, untagged library
          shows a small sample so the view is never blank.

        <h2>Placed by genre, lit by energy.</h2>
        <p>
          Each track is a point, clustered near others in its genre. Colour runs an ink-to-vermilion ramp by
          energy: calmer tracks dark, higher-energy tracks bright. Faint lines wire each track to its nearest
          neighbour in the same scene. Scroll to zoom, drag to pan.
        </p>
        <p>
          The left rail recolours and filters the whole map live. Recolour by <strong>energy</strong>,{' '}
          <strong>tag confidence</strong>, <strong>tag source</strong>, <strong>acoustic analysis</strong>, or
          the acoustic signals the DJ now hears — <strong>loudness</strong>, <strong>pace</strong>, and{' '}
          <strong>voice</strong> (vocal vs instrumental); filter by scene, mood, energy band, or tag source, or
          search by title, artist, or album. The panels on the right keep a running read of whatever is in view:
          the energy split, the mood field, tempo and loudness histograms, a Camelot key wheel, and the
          major/minor and vocal/instrumental balance.

          Selecting a track opens its full record: BPM, musical key, energy, length, mood and last.fm tags,
          tag confidence, loudness, and the acoustic-analysis score. A <strong>song-shape</strong> timeline
          charts the track end to end — its pace curve, structural sections, where the intro ends, the vocal
          passages, and how the key moves over time. Below that sit the track's learned embedding fingerprints,
          the text vector and (when analysed) the audio vector, drawn as heatmaps.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Mix Next</strong> lists the closest tracks in vector space, the same similarity the DJ
          leans on when it reaches for what to play next. Those neighbours are wired back onto the map in
          vermilion so you can see where they sit.

        <h2>From a few hundred to tens of thousands.</h2>
        <p>
          The map draws up to <strong>10,000</strong> tracks by default and can be dialled to 50,000 with the{' '}
          <strong>MAP SIZE</strong> control in the rail. Beyond the cap it shows a stratified sample spread
          evenly across genres, so the shape stays honest rather than over-weighting whichever genres sort
          first; a header badge tells you when you are seeing a sample.
        </p>
        <p>
          Small libraries render as crisp vector nodes; larger ones switch automatically to a canvas renderer
          that stays smooth into the tens of thousands. You don't pick: it chooses the right one for the size.
