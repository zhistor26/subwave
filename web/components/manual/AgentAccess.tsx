        <h2>An MCP server for the station.</h2>
        <p>

          </a>,{' '}
          the standard way an AI agent like Claude reaches an external tool. It is the
          agent-facing twin of the listener request panel: where a human types into the
          browser, an agent calls a tool, and the same controller does the work.
        </p>
        <p className="text-muted">
          The server holds no logic of its own; each tool is a typed wrapper over one
          controller endpoint. The agent never sees a URL or an auth header, only the
          five intent-shaped tools below.

          queues a track (it never interrupts the song that's playing) and it's
          rate-limited. The two DJ-control tools speak immediately.

          The three read-and-request tools need no credentials: they map to the same
          public, rate-limited endpoints a browser uses. The two DJ-control tools, which
          put a voice on air, are gated: the server sends the station's{' '}

          <code className="bs-code-inline">ADMIN_PASS</code> as a Basic auth header, read
          from its own environment. Without them, an agent can still see what's on air
          and request songs; it just can't drive the DJ.

          then point any MCP client (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, or another) at the
          built <code className="bs-code-inline">dist/index.js</code>, passing the
          controller URL and, optionally, the admin credentials as environment variables.
