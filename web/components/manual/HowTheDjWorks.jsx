        <h2>One song ends, the DJ chooses the next.</h2>
        <p>
          Every time a track finishes, the DJ picks what follows. It builds a pool of
          candidates from your library — songs in a similar mood, similar artists,
          recently-added and frequently-played albums, matching playlists — and the LLM
          chooses from that pool, steering by the time of day, the weather, and the
          current mood. When nothing's been requested, it runs a fallback playlist so the
          music never stops.

        <h2>Personas, picked at random.</h2>
        <p>
          The operator gives the DJ one to ten <em>souls</em> — distinct personas, each
          with its own name and character. Before each spoken moment the station picks one
          at random, so the voice on air shifts through the day rather than reading from a
          single script. Each line is generated fresh; the DJ doesn't repeat itself.
        </p>
        <p className="muted">
          The spoken audio is rendered by a text-to-speech engine — a fast local voice by
          default, or a more natural one if the operator configures it.

      <section className="bs-section">
        <p className="bs-eyebrow">WHEN IT TALKS</p>
        <h2>Links, IDs, the time, the weather.</h2>
        <p>
          Between tracks the DJ does what radio DJs do — a short link tying one song to
          the next, a station ID, the time at the top of the hour, a weather note when the
          conditions change. Spoken segments ride <em>over</em> the music: the track ducks
          down while the DJ talks, then comes back up.
        </p>
        <p>
          How chatty the station is depends on a <strong>frequency</strong> setting the
          operator chooses — <em>quiet</em>, <em>moderate</em>, or <em>aggressive</em>. A
          quiet station checks the time every couple of hours and drops the occasional
          ID; an aggressive one gives you full idents and weather updates through the hour.

      <section className="bs-section">
        <p className="bs-eyebrow">SHOWS &amp; SESSIONS</p>
        <h2>It keeps a thread going.</h2>
        <p>
          The DJ runs in <em>sessions</em> — a continuous block with a memory of what it's
          already played and said, so its links stay coherent instead of starting cold
          each time. A session can be a scheduled <strong>show</strong> the operator paints
          onto a weekly grid, or an autonomous block keyed to the time of day and the
          dominant mood. When the show changes or the block ages out, the session rolls
          over to a fresh one and carries a short handoff forward.
