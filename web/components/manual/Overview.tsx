        <h2>It's a broadcast, not a playlist.</h2>
        <p>
          Streaming apps give everyone a private channel — shuffled for you, paused the
          second you look away. SUB/WAVE goes the other way. There is one Icecast stream,
          and everyone hears whatever is on the air <em>right now</em>. There is no
          &ldquo;for you,&rdquo; and there is no skip button. You can ask for a song, but
          it joins the broadcast for every listener. It doesn't jump the current track.
