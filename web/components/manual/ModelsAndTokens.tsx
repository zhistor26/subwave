        <p>
          Every word the DJ speaks and every track it picks comes from one language
          model, chosen under <strong>Admin &rarr; LLM</strong>. The default is Ollama on
          your own hardware — no API key, no per-token bill — but you can point the
          station at a hosted provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google and others) instead.
          Switching reroutes every call immediately, with no redeploy.

          Big hosted models are more capable but cost money per token; small local models
          are free to run but need a lighter workload to stay coherent. The settings
          below let you match the station to the model — run it <em>lean</em> for a small
          or metered model, or <em>rich</em> for a large capable one.

        <h2>For small models &amp; saving tokens.</h2>
        <p>
          If you're on a modest local model, or paying per token and want the bill low,
          these are the dials to turn down. None of them take the DJ off the air. They
          just make it do less work per moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          With these settings in place, a small model runs the whole station
          comfortably — a 9B-class local model such as{' '}
          <strong>Qwen3.5 9B</strong> is plenty for picking tracks and writing the DJ's
          lines. The lean profile keeps each request short and well-shaped, which is
          exactly what a smaller model needs to stay reliable.
        </p>
        <ul className="bs-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Reasoning off</strong> (Admin &rarr; LLM) — stops &ldquo;thinking&rdquo;
            models from writing a long internal monologue before they answer. The DJ
            writes short scripts that don't need it, and an unbounded thinking step makes
            every call balloon on a small model. Off is the safe default.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Picker agent off</strong> (Admin &rarr; LLM) — swaps the
            conversational track-picking agent for the simpler pool picker. The agent
            holds a running chat history and works through tools step by step; the pool
            picker instead hands the model one short, pre-built shortlist and asks for a
            single choice. Far fewer tokens, and a much easier task for a small model to
            get right.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Pause when empty on</strong> (Admin &rarr; LLM) — when nobody is
            listening, the DJ stops picking, talking and writing IDs entirely; the stream
            coasts on the fallback playlist and the DJ wakes up the moment someone tunes
            in. This one is a pure saving: there's no quality cost, since there's no one
            there to hear it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Concise scripts</strong> (Admin &rarr; Personas) — each persona's
            script length can be <em>concise</em> or <em>extended</em>. Concise keeps
            spoken breaks to a line or two; extended roughly doubles them. Concise means
            fewer tokens out on every segment.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Quiet frequency</strong> (Admin &rarr; Personas) — a persona's
            frequency sets how often it talks, IDs the station and reads the time and
            weather. <em>Quiet</em> makes all of that rarer, so there are simply fewer AI
            calls per hour.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sound FX off</strong> (Admin &rarr; Sound FX) — with the effects
            library disabled, the DJ is no longer shown the catalogue of stingers when it
            plans a segment, which trims that prompt.

        <h2>For large, capable models.</h2>
        <p>
          On a large hosted model the same dials go the other way — spend the capability
          on a station with more personality and a smarter DJ.

        <ul className="bs-list">

            <strong>Reasoning on</strong> (Admin &rarr; LLM) — let a thinking model work
            through its choice before answering. Worth it only on a model built for it,
            and on a generous token budget.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Picker agent on</strong> (Admin &rarr; LLM) — the full conversational
            DJ: it remembers the session, reasons about what it has already played, and
            uses tools to dig through the library. Richer and more coherent, but it leans
            on the model being capable.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Extended scripts</strong> (Admin &rarr; Personas) — a storytelling DJ
            that lingers, with longer links between tracks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Aggressive frequency</strong> (Admin &rarr; Personas) — a busy
            station: frequent IDs, time checks and weather updates.

        <div className="bs-eyebrow">THE DJ NEVER GOES SILENT</div>
        <p>
          The picker agent has a built-in safety net: if it ever fails or runs too slow,
          the station quietly falls back to the simple pool picker for that track — the
          same path you'd get with the agent switched off. Turning it off just makes that
          lighter path the default rather than the exception.
