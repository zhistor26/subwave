        <h2>One thing: a between-track line.</h2>
        <p>
          A SUB/WAVE skill is a single between-track <em>spoken segment</em> — the DJ
          glances at something, then either says one short line over the music or stays
          quiet. The format borrows from{' '}
          <a href="https://github.com/anthropics/skills" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
            Anthropic&rsquo;s skills
          </a>{' '}
          (a <code className="bs-code-inline">SKILL.md</code> with YAML frontmatter and a
          markdown body, plus optional code), but the meaning is narrower. These don&rsquo;t
          process documents or run tasks; they decide what the DJ says next.

          Drop a folder into <code className="bs-code-inline">state/skills/</code>. It needs a{' '}
          <code className="bs-code-inline">SKILL.md</code>; an optional{' '}
          <code className="bs-code-inline">tool.mjs</code> lets the segment look at live data
          before the DJ speaks.

        <h2>Frontmatter, then the brief.</h2>
        <p>
          The frontmatter sets the skill&rsquo;s metadata; the markdown body <em>is</em> the
          brief the DJ follows: what to say, in what tone, and when to stay silent. Only a
          non-empty body is required; every key has a sensible default.

name: moon-phase          # the slug (defaults to the folder name)
label: Moon phase         # label shown in admin (defaults to a title-cased name)
cooldown: 6h              # min gap between auto firings — "90m" | "6h" | "2d" | "45" (minutes)

If tonight's moon is at a notable phase, work it into one short, in-character
line, the way a late-night presenter might glance out the window. Skip it when
the phase is unremarkable.`}</CodeBlock>
        <p className="text-muted">
          For a <em>new</em> skill the <code className="bs-code-inline">name</code> must be a
          lowercase slug that isn&rsquo;t a built-in kind; naming a folder after a built-in
          <em>edits</em> that one instead (see below). Bad frontmatter is logged and
          skipped, and never crashes the station.

        <h2>The shipped skills are files too.</h2>
        <p>
          The seven built-ins — weather, news, traffic, curiosity, album anniversaries,
          library deep-cuts, and web search — are written into{' '}
          <code className="bs-code-inline">state/skills/&lt;kind&gt;/SKILL.md</code> the first
          time the station boots. Editing one (on the admin <strong>Skills</strong> page, or
          the file directly) overrides its brief, cooldown, or label in place. A built-in
          file may leave the body empty to keep the default wording, and never loads a{' '}
          <code className="bs-code-inline">tool.mjs</code>; the built-ins already have their
          data wired in.

          The big one: <strong>News reads the BBC by default</strong>. Hit{' '}
          <strong>Edit</strong> on the News skill, paste your own RSS feed (any RSS 2.0 feed,
          though not Atom yet) and rewrite the brief in your station&rsquo;s
          voice, then Save. It&rsquo;s live on the next break, no restart.

One fresh headline in a single sentence — in the station's voice,
not a newsreader's. Skip anything dull or stale; silence is fine.`}</CodeBlock>

          The <code className="bs-code-inline">NEWS_FEED_URL</code> environment variable only
          seeds this file on the very first boot — after that the file (or the admin form)
          wins.

        <h2>Let the DJ look before it speaks.</h2>
        <p>
          With a <code className="bs-code-inline">tool.mjs</code>, the DJ can fetch live data
          before deciding whether to air the line, the same mechanism the built-in weather
          and news skills use. Export a default function; return any JSON, and use{' '}
          <code className="bs-code-inline">{`{ available: false }`}</code> to tell the DJ
          there&rsquo;s nothing worth airing.

        <p>
          The call is timeout-guarded and any error degrades cleanly to &ldquo;no
          data&rdquo;; a slow or broken skill can never hang the station. With no{' '}

          A freshly dropped skill appears on the admin <strong>Skills</strong> page toggled{' '}
