        <h2>The station&rsquo;s own terminal app.</h2>
        <p>
          Start here: SUB/WAVE ships its own terminal player. Where the other apps below just
          carry the audio, the TUI mirrors the browser player &mdash; now-playing with track
          metadata, the timeline of recent and upcoming songs, the live booth feed, and a
          request form.
        </p>
        <p>
          It&rsquo;s built into the operator console, so there&rsquo;s nothing separate to
          install. From a SUB/WAVE checkout, run <code className="bs-code-inline">npm
          start</code> and choose <strong>play</strong> — the TUI opens pointed at your stack:

        <CodeBlock>{`npm start        # then choose "play"`}</CodeBlock>
        <p className="text-muted">
          For audio it wants <code className="bs-code-inline">mpv</code> (preferred &mdash; it
          allows live volume control) or <code className="bs-code-inline">ffplay</code>; with
          neither installed the TUI still runs as a read-only dashboard. The same console also
          opens the web player and admin in your browser &mdash;{' '}

        <h2>The stream URL.</h2>
        <p>
          Every external player asks for the same thing: the address of the stream. For
          this station it is <code className="bs-code-inline">/stream.mp3</code> on the
          station&rsquo;s own domain &mdash;
        </p>
        <StreamUrl />
        <p className="text-muted">
          Paste that into any of the apps below. It is a live broadcast, so there is no
          pause and no seek &mdash; closing the app and reopening it drops you back
          wherever the station is <em>now</em>, not where you left off.

          <div className="bs-eyebrow">OPUS, IF YOUR PLAYER SUPPORTS IT</div>
          <p>
            The station also serves <code className="bs-code-inline">/stream.opus</code>{' '}
            (Ogg-Opus, 96&nbsp;kbps) on the same domain. It sounds equal-or-better and uses
            roughly half the bandwidth of the MP3 mount. The in-browser player picks it
            automatically when supported; for external apps try Opus first and fall back
            to MP3 if the player refuses it. MP3 stays the universal recommendation for
            Sonos, hardware internet radios, car receivers, and older mobile devices.

        <p>
          VLC is the most reliable way to tune in outside the browser &mdash; the safe
          first choice. It runs on every desktop and mobile platform, opens the stream
          from a single URL, and buffers generously enough that a shaky connection rarely
          interrupts the broadcast. It is free and open-source: desktop builds come from{' '}

          and <strong>VLC</strong> on Google Play.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whichever device you are on, point VLC at its <em>network stream</em> option,
          not <em>open file</em>, and give it the URL above:

        <p>
          Once it is playing, VLC shows the live track and artist from the stream&rsquo;s
          metadata &mdash; the same now-playing info the browser player displays. On
          desktop you can drag the stream into the Playlist and save it as an{' '}
          <code className="bs-code-inline">.m3u</code> for one-click tuning later; on
          mobile it stays in VLC&rsquo;s history under the Network tab.

          <div className="bs-eyebrow">IF THE CONNECTION IS FLAKY</div>
          <p>
            VLC&rsquo;s default buffer is short. On a weak connection, raise it: desktop
            users open <em>Preferences → Show All → Input / Codecs</em> and lift{' '}

            A deeper buffer trades a few seconds of start-up delay for a steadier stream.
