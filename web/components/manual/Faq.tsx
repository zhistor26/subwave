        <h2>What happens when no one is listening?</h2>
        <p>
          By default, nothing changes — the station broadcasts the same whether anyone is
          tuned in or not. But there is an optional setting,{' '}
          <strong>Pause when empty</strong>, that changes this. With it on, the moment the
          listener count hits zero the DJ stops doing AI work: no track-picking, no spoken
          links, no station IDs. The music keeps flowing from a fallback playlist so the
          stream never goes silent, and the DJ wakes straight back up the instant someone
          tunes in. It exists to save tokens — and money, on a paid model — when there is
          no one there to hear the DJ anyway. See{' '}

        <h2>Does it work with a small model?</h2>
        <p>
          Yes. The AI DJ doesn&rsquo;t need a frontier model — a modest one running on
          your own hardware is plenty. A 9B-class local model such as Qwen3.5 9B
          comfortably picks tracks and writes the DJ&rsquo;s lines, as long as you run the
          station on its <em>lean</em> settings: reasoning off, the simpler track-picker,
          concise scripts. The full set of dials, and what to turn which way, is on the{' '}

        <p className="bs-eyebrow">A TAGGED LIBRARY</p>
        <h2>What is mood tagging?</h2>
        <p>
          Every track in the library can carry a <em>mood</em> — a label like calm,
          energetic or reflective. The station tags the library in the background, and the
          DJ leans on those tags to pick music that fits the moment: the time of day, the
          weather, the show that is on. A well-tagged library gives the DJ a far richer
          palette to choose from. You can watch the tagger&rsquo;s progress on the Library
          page in the admin console. Untagged tracks still play — they just don&rsquo;t
          get matched by feel.

        <h2>What are the &ldquo;deploy&rdquo; and &ldquo;start&rdquo; SUB/WAVE skills?</h2>
        <p>
          These are two helper skills bundled with the project for whoever runs the
          station, used through Claude Code. <strong>subwave-deploy</strong> handles
          installing and updating — a first-time setup from a fresh checkout, or pulling
          the latest code and rebuilding only the parts that actually changed.{' '}
          <strong>subwave-control</strong> is lighter: it simply starts or stops the
          station in development or production mode, with no builds. Day to day you reach
          for <em>control</em>; after a code change you reach for <em>deploy</em>. The
          hands-on steps they automate are written out in{' '}

        <p className="bs-eyebrow">CHOOSING THE NEXT SONG</p>
        <h2>What are the candidate pool and the agentic picker?</h2>
        <p>
          They are two ways the DJ chooses what to play next. The{' '}
          <strong>candidate pool</strong> picker is the straightforward one: it gathers a
          shortlist of tracks from your library — similar songs, similar artists, mood
          matches, recently-added and frequently-played albums — caps it to a couple of
          dozen, and asks the model to pick one from that list.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <strong>agentic picker</strong> is the richer one. It runs as a small
          reasoning loop with a memory of the current session and tools to search the
          library itself, so its choices — and the links between them — stay coherent
          across a run rather than starting cold each time. It is on by default; if it
          ever fails or runs slow, the station quietly falls back to the candidate pool,
          so the music never stops either way. Which one suits you comes down to the
          model — see <Link href="/manual/llm" className="bs-link">Models &amp; Tokens</Link>.

      <section className="bs-section">
        <p className="bs-eyebrow">WHEN SOMETHING&rsquo;S OFF</p>
        <h2>Why is there a debug page?</h2>
        <p>
          The admin console&rsquo;s Debug page is a live snapshot of the station&rsquo;s
          inner workings — the most recent AI calls and whether they succeeded, the audio
          mixer&rsquo;s status, and the latest log lines. You don&rsquo;t need it day to
          day, but it is the first place to look when something is off: the stream stalls,
          the DJ goes quiet, or a voice sounds wrong. It turns a vague
          &ldquo;something&rsquo;s broken&rdquo; into a specific, visible cause. More on it
          in <Link href="/manual/admin" className="bs-link">Admin &amp; Settings</Link>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a deeper look there is also <strong>subwave-log-analysis</strong>, a bundled
          skill used through Claude Code. Where the Debug page shows the live moment, this
          reads the station&rsquo;s full event log over time and reports back on how it
          has been behaving — how often it calls the music library, why the picker keeps
          favouring certain artists, whether the library pool is too narrow, and any
          runtime anomalies. It is the tool for &ldquo;the station works, but something
          feels off&rdquo; rather than an outright break.
