        The model behind it is the operator’s choice — a local Ollama box, or a
        hosted provider like Anthropic, OpenAI, or Google. The voice is just as
        swappable: bundled Piper and Kokoro run on-device, or a cloud voice from
        OpenAI or ElevenLabs. Change either one in the console and the next
        spoken line uses it. No redeploy.
