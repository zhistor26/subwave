# SUB/WAVE broadcast supervisor.
#
# Bash (not /bin/sh) because we need `wait -n` to react to whichever child
# exits first. The savonet/liquidsoap base image's /bin/sh is dash, which
# lacks `wait -n`; bash is in the same image (debian) so this is free.
#
# Launches icecast2 and liquidsoap in one container and exits as soon as
# either dies, so the container's restart policy bounces the pair together.
# This replaces the earlier two-container split (subwave-icecast +
# subwave-liquidsoap) and the icecast-secrets handshake that bridged them.
#
# Boot sequence:
#   1. Pre-create the shared /var/sub-wave subdirs with mode 777 so the
#      controller (running as a different uid) can write into them. Same role
#      the old subwave-icecast entrypoint played for the wider stack — it just
#      happens to also be where this container's own state lives now.
#   2. Resolve the three ICECAST_*_PASSWORD values. Precedence (unchanged):
#        env override > persisted state/icecast-secrets.env > freshly generated.
#      The resolved values are still written back to state/icecast-secrets.env
#      for operator visibility and to keep the documented "delete the file +
#      restart to rotate" path working.
#   3. Render icecast.xml from the baked-in template.
#   4. Launch icecast2 (as icecast2 user) in the background.
#   5. Wait for icecast to accept HTTP connections (so liquidsoap doesn't
#      immediately fail its source connect).
#   6. Launch liquidsoap (as liquidsoap user) in the background with the
#      resolved ICECAST_SOURCE_PASSWORD + ICECAST_HOST=localhost in its env.
#   7. `wait -n` for whichever exits first; tear the other down; exit.
