"""
subwave-tts-heavy — optional Chatterbox + PocketTTS sidecar for SUB/WAVE.

The controller (controller/src/audio/chatterbox.ts, audio/pocketTts.ts) talks
to this service over HTTP when TTS_HEAVY_URL is set in its environment. The
shared /var/sub-wave volume is mounted in both containers, so the sidecar
writes the WAV to the absolute `out` path the controller asks for, and the
controller hands the same path to Liquidsoap via next.txt / say.txt /
intro.txt. No audio over the wire — only metadata.

Architecture: this is a thin FastAPI shim. The real inference happens in two
long-lived Python subprocesses — the SAME stdio worker scripts the controller
uses for its in-process build (controller/scripts/{chatterbox,pocket_tts}_
worker.py). Each runs in its own venv (/opt/chatterbox/venv,
/opt/pocket-tts/venv) because chatterbox-tts and pocket-tts have incompatible
pip resolutions in a single env. asyncio.Lock per worker serialises requests
so two simultaneous DJ lines don't interleave.

Endpoints:
  GET  /health   → {ok, engines, chatterbox_loaded, pocket_loaded}
  POST /speak    → {ok, path, duration_s}
    body: {engine, text, voice?, reference_wav?, out}
