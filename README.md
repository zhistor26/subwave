# SUB/WAVE

**A personal internet radio station.** One Icecast stream, one broadcast —
every listener hears the same thing at the same time. An AI DJ picks the
tracks, writes the links, and reads station idents, the time, and the weather
between songs. Listeners can request music in plain language; the DJ matches
it, intros it, and queues it.

It is *radio*, not a playlist. There is no per-listener shuffle, no skip
button, no "up next for you." You tune in and hear whatever is on.

## Why it's built this way

A playlist is a list you control. Radio is a broadcast you join. SUB/WAVE
deliberately chooses the second model:

- **One shared stream.** A single Icecast mount everyone connects to. The
  shared-moment quality is the point — it's the difference between a jukebox
  and a station.
- **No skip.** Track-end is the only natural transition. The DJ — human-curated
  personas plus an LLM — owns pacing, not the listener. (Operators *can* skip
  via the admin API; listeners cannot.)
- **AI as the DJ, not the catalogue.** The music is your own library (served by
  Navidrome over the Subsonic API). The LLM curates, sequences, and talks — it
  doesn't generate the music or replace your taste.
- **Self-hosted and swappable.** Runs on one Linux box behind Cloudflare. The
  LLM provider is swappable at runtime (Ollama, Anthropic, OpenAI, Google,
  OpenRouter, Vercel AI Gateway) with no redeploy.

## Architecture

Four cooperating processes. The load-bearing design fact: the **controller**
and **Liquidsoap** talk only through files in a shared `state/` directory —
there is no socket or RPC channel between them.

### The four processes

| Process | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Controller** (`controller/`, Node/Express) | The brain. Runs the AI DJ — picks tracks, writes links/idents, matches listener requests, runs the cron scheduler, renders TTS. Exposes the HTTP API. |
| **Liquidsoap** (`liquidsoap/radio.liq`) | The mixing desk. Builds the audio pipeline: request queue → auto-playlist, crossfades, ducks voice over music, mixes jingles, brick-wall limiter, encodes to MP3. |
| **Icecast** | The transmitter. Serves the single `/stream.mp3` mount to every listener. |
| **Web UI** (`web/`, Next.js 15) | The receiver. Player, marketing landing page, setup walkthrough, and an admin shell for settings/debug. PWA-installable with OS lock-screen controls. |

### File-based IPC

Everything that flows between the controller and Liquidsoap goes through one
of these files in `state/`:

| File | Direction | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `next.txt` | controller → LS | Next annotated track URI. LS polls every 1.0s. |
| `say.txt` | controller → LS | WAV path for a spoken segment (station ID, time, weather, request intro). Heavy-ducked over music. |
| `intro.txt` | controller → LS | WAV path for a between-track DJ link. Light-ducked so the new song stays audible. |
| `auto.m3u` | controller → LS | Fallback playlist for the current mood, rewritten hourly. |
| `now-playing.json` | LS → controller/UI | Current track metadata, written from Liquidsoap's metadata hook. |

The web UI polls the controller over HTTP (`/now-playing`, `/state` every 5s).
Browsers pull audio directly from Icecast.

## Quick start (CLI — recommended)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.subwave.com | sh    # installs `subwave` to /usr/local/bin
subwave init                               # scaffolds ~/subwave with compose + .env
subwave start                              # docker compose up -d
subwave setup                              # configure Navidrome, LLM, TTS, DJ persona
```

`subwave init` asks where to install (default `~/subwave`), picks the
deployment shape (prod / prod-byo), and writes the compose file + a 3-var
`.env`. The standalone CLI doesn't need a clone, doesn't need Node on the host,
and works from anywhere — `subwave status`, `subwave logs controller`,
`subwave update`, `subwave self-update` all just work.

The configuration wizard probes Navidrome and your LLM provider live, persists
everything to `state/`, and flips the station on-air. Cloud LLM/TTS API keys
land in `state/secrets.env` (mode 0600); Navidrome creds + the "setup done"
flag land in `state/setup-config.json`; everything else (DJ persona, jingle
ratio, shows) goes through the existing `settings.json`.

## Quick start (no CLI, raw docker)

If you'd rather skip our binary on your host and stick to `docker compose`:

```bash
mkdir subwave && cd subwave
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/perminder-klair/subwave/main/docker-compose.yml
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/perminder-klair/subwave/main/.env.example
mv .env.example .env
# Edit .env — set ADMIN_USER, ADMIN_PASS, SITE_URL (three vars, that's it).
docker compose up -d
# Then open https://your-host/onboarding — the web wizard collects Navidrome,
# LLM, TTS, DJ persona, and offers to render jingles.
```

Functionally identical — same images, same state layout, same persistence.
The CLI just saves you the curl-and-edit dance and gives you `subwave logs`,
`subwave doctor`, etc. for the rest of the lifecycle.

### Local dev (contributors)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/perminder-klair/subwave.git && cd subwave
./scripts/setup.sh                                  # scaffolds a 3-var root .env + state/
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d      # Icecast + Liquidsoap + Controller
cd web && npm install && npm run dev                # web UI on :7700 — separate, hot-reloading
# Then http://localhost:7700/onboarding to finish configuration.
```

Dev compose bind-mounts `controller/src/`, `radio.liq`, and `sounds/` from the
repo. Controller runs under `tsx watch` so `src/**` edits hot-reload inside
the container; `radio.liq` edits just need a `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml restart liquidsoap`.

The standalone `subwave` CLI works inside the cloned repo too — `cd subwave &&
subwave start dev` does the right thing. The contributor convenience is `npm
start`, which `tsx`-runs the CLI source directly so unreleased changes are
exercised — same commands, same flags, no `npm install -g` needed.

The same CLI doubles as the console for running the station. Run `npm start`
for a status-aware menu; every menu action is also a one-shot subcommand —
append it after `npm start --`:

```bash
npm start                       # interactive operator console (status-aware menu)
npm start -- setup              # first-boot wizard — Navidrome, LLM, admin, env files
npm start -- status             # compose env, services, now-playing, recent events
npm start -- doctor             # full diagnostic sweep
npm start -- start dev          # docker compose up -d (dev or prod)
npm start -- restart liquidsoap # plain restart (radio.liq is bind-mounted)
npm start -- restart controller # rebuild + recreate (source is COPY-d at build)
npm start -- logs controller    # tail one service
npm start -- play               # SUB/WAVE TUI — the terminal player
npm start -- listen             # open the web player in a browser
npm start -- admin              # open the admin console in a browser
npm start -- stop               # docker compose down (confirms first)
```

## Production deploy

Single Linux host, Cloudflare terminating TLS, Caddy routing to four internal
services. The [no-clone quickstart above](#quick-start-no-clone-required) is
the canonical path — `curl` two files, fill in three vars, `docker compose
up -d`, finish setup in the browser. See **[`DEPLOY.md`](DEPLOY.md)** for host
prerequisites, Cloudflare setup, updates, and backup.

**Bring your own reverse proxy.** If you already run Traefik, nginx, or your
own Caddy in your homelab, swap the bundled-Caddy compose for the BYO variant:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.byo.yml up -d
```

That exposes the web UI on `:7700`, the controller API on `:7701`, and the
Icecast stream on `:7702` (all configurable). Point your proxy at those three —
`docker/Caddyfile` is a working reference for the route table you need to
replicate. Details in [`DEPLOY.md`](DEPLOY.md#bring-your-own-reverse-proxy).

**Images on GHCR.** Tagged releases publish to `ghcr.io/perminder-klair/subwave-{caddy,icecast,controller,liquidsoap,web}`.
All compose files pull `:latest` by default; pin a version with
`SUBWAVE_VERSION=v1.2.3` in the root `.env`.

## Repository layout

  src/music/       Subsonic client, pool picker, library tagging
  src/audio/       TTS engines: Piper, Kokoro, Chatterbox, cloud
  src/routes/      HTTP API split by surface (public, request, settings, …)
liquidsoap/        radio.liq — the Liquidsoap mixing pipeline
web/               Next.js 15 web UI (player, landing, admin, setup)
tui/               Terminal player — the listener UI, in your terminal
docker/            Two compose files (dev + prod), Caddyfile, Dockerfiles
scripts/           setup, jingle generation, update, health check
mcp-subwave/       MCP server — lets an agent request songs / drive the DJ
cli/               Operator CLI (TS, run via tsx loader — no build step)
bin/subwave        Operator CLI entry — setup, status, doctor, lifecycle, play
```

## Notable details

- **Controller code needs a rebuild, not a restart** — its source is `COPY`d at
  image build time. `radio.liq` is bind-mounted, so a Liquidsoap restart is
  enough after editing it.
- **The LLM provider is swappable at runtime** from the admin UI — every model
  call goes through the Vercel AI SDK.
- **There is no `/skip` for listeners.** Track-end is the only natural
  transition; operators have an admin-only skip endpoint.
- Several areas (queue/playback path, `radio.liq`, the crossfade, voice
  ducking, the LLM layer) have **non-obvious constraints** that are easy to
  regress. Read the relevant note in **[`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md)** before
  touching them.
