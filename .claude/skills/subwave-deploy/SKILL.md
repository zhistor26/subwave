description: Set up, deploy, or update SUB/WAVE (a personal internet radio station). On a fresh checkout, runs scripts/setup.sh, prompts for Navidrome + Ollama credentials, brings the stack up, and generates jingles. On an already-running stack, pulls the latest, rebuilds only the Docker services whose code actually changed, recreates them, and verifies the stream is on-air. Use this skill any time the user wants to install, set up, bootstrap, deploy, update, sync, redeploy, refresh, restart, or "pull and restart" SUB/WAVE — including phrases like "set up subwave", "install subwave", "first boot", "bootstrap the radio", "pull subwave", "update the radio", "deploy subwave", "rebuild controller", "restart sub-wave", "redeploy after pull", "git pull and restart as needed", "check if the stream is healthy", or simply "deploy" / "install" / "set up" while in the subwave repo. Trigger proactively whenever the user is working in the subwave repo and mentions setting up, installing, deploying, updating, rebuilding, restarting, or checking the running stack — even if they don't name the skill. Free to pull, rebuild, recreate, render Icecast config, generate jingles, and run health probes; confirm before destructive ops like wiping `state/`, removing volumes, full `down -v`, or overwriting an existing controller/.env that already has the operator's Navidrome password.

# SUB/WAVE deploy

Bring the SUB/WAVE radio stack up — from a fresh checkout or from an already-running install — with the minimum churn the situation needs. A first-time setup takes a few minutes (build + first jingle render). A clean update with no rebuild takes seconds; a full rebuild a minute or two.

The user has authorised free action on this hot path — `scripts/setup.sh`, `git pull`, `docker compose build`, `up -d`, `generate-jingles.sh`, log scans, health probes. Pause and confirm only for the genuinely destructive moves listed at the bottom.

## The five facts the workflow turns on

1. **Two compose files, two shapes.**
   - `docker/docker-compose.yml` — dev variant (Mac smoke-test): Icecast + Liquidsoap + Controller only. Web runs separately via `npm run dev`. State at `../state`.
   - `docker/docker-compose.prod.yml` — production single-host: adds `web` and `caddy`. **Only Caddy binds a host port.** State at `${STATE_DIR:-<repo>/state}` — repo-local by default, same as dev.
   - Detect which is up from `docker compose -f <file> ps`. On this host, prod is the live one and Caddy is mapped to host port `4800` (`0.0.0.0:4800->80/tcp`), not `80` as the README suggests — always read the port from `ps`, never hardcode.

2. **Controller and Liquidsoap COPY source at build time, they do not bind-mount it.** `docker compose restart <svc>` reruns the *same baked-in code* and does nothing for source changes. Source changes need `up -d --build <svc>`. This is the single most common deploy mistake.

3. **Web in dev is hot-reloaded** (Next.js `npm run dev`); web in prod is a built standalone image and needs `--build` on any `web/**` change.

4. **The IPC between Controller and Liquidsoap is file-based** through the shared `state/` (mounted at `/var/sub-wave`). When you recreate one of them, in-flight `next.txt`/`say.txt`/`now-playing.json` may be mid-write — accept a few-second blip; don't keep recreating to "fix" it. **But there is a worse failure here, and it has bitten in production:** a near-simultaneous recreate of *both* `controller` and `liquidsoap` (which is exactly what `up -d --build controller web` triggers, because the `depends_on` graph also recreates `liquidsoap`) can have Liquidsoap pick up a bad/empty IPC request and **wedge a source into a `fail`/`blank` loop**. The result is silent but invisible: `/api/health` still says `on-air`, `/stream.mp3` still flows bytes, `/api/now-playing` still rotates tracks — but the audio is digital silence (~-91 dB). The cure is a plain `docker compose ... restart` (no rebuild — code is already baked in); it clears the wedged source state. The detector is an **audio-level probe**, not the health endpoint — see Step 5.

5. **Compose dependency ordering will recreate more than you asked for.** Asking to recreate `controller` and `web` will also recreate `liquidsoap` because of the `depends_on` graph. That's fine — same image, no source change means no behaviour change. Don't be surprised by it and don't fight it.

## Workflow

This skill is checked into the SUB/WAVE repo. `$REPO` below is the repo root —
derive it once, don't hardcode it:

```bash
REPO=$(git -C "<this skill's base directory>" rev-parse --show-toplevel)
```

`<this skill's base directory>` is the absolute path shown as "Base directory
for this skill" when the skill loads. Shell state does not persist between
commands, so re-derive `$REPO` (or substitute its value) in each block below.

### Step 0 — Detect the install state

Before anything else, figure out which mode you're in. Three possibilities:

```bash
cd "$REPO"

# Are containers up?
RUNNING_PROD=$(docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.prod.yml ps -q 2>/dev/null)
RUNNING_DEV=$(docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml      ps -q 2>/dev/null)

# Has setup.sh been run? (it produces docker/.env and a rendered icecast.xml)
[ -f docker/.env ] && echo "docker/.env present"
[ -f controller/.env ] && echo "controller/.env present"

# Resolve the real STATE_DIR. State lives in <repo>/state by default; an
# operator can relocate it via STATE_DIR in docker/.env. docker compose reads
# docker/.env automatically, but your shell does NOT — so derive it yourself,
# falling back to the repo-local default. (cwd is $REPO here, so `state` is
# <repo>/state.) Don't probe a bare /var/lib path — that default no longer exists.
STATE_DIR=$(grep -E '^STATE_DIR=' docker/.env 2>/dev/null | cut -d= -f2- | tr -d '"')
STATE_DIR=${STATE_DIR:-state}
[ -f "$STATE_DIR/icecast.xml" ] && echo "icecast.xml rendered ($STATE_DIR)"
```

Three modes:

- **Fresh checkout** — no containers, missing `docker/.env`, missing `controller/.env`, missing rendered `icecast.xml`. Go to the **initial-setup path** (Steps F1–F5 below).
- **Configured but down** — env files exist, rendered config exists, but no containers running. Go to **first-boot path** (Steps B1–B3 below).
- **Running** — at least one container up. Go to the **update path** (Steps 1–6 below). This is the normal everyday case.

A user saying "set up subwave" or "first boot" almost certainly means fresh checkout; "deploy" or "pull and restart" almost certainly means running. When ambiguous, ask once.

---

### Initial-setup path — fresh checkout

#### F1 — Prerequisites

The host needs: `docker` (with the `compose` plugin), `git`, `openssl`, `ffmpeg` (used by `setup.sh` to generate `emergency.mp3` and `bed.mp3`), and ideally `envsubst` (`gettext-base` on Debian; setup.sh falls back to `sed` if absent).

```bash
for c in docker git openssl ffmpeg envsubst; do
  command -v $c >/dev/null && echo "ok: $c" || echo "MISSING: $c"
done
docker compose version
```

If anything's missing, surface it. Don't auto-install system packages — that's a sudo-level human decision.

#### F2 — Controller credentials

`controller/.env` is the file the operator has to fill in by hand: Navidrome URL/user/pass, Ollama URL/model. Everything else has sensible defaults. If it already exists, leave it alone (it may already be filled in). If it doesn't, seed it from the example **but then pause and prompt the user** for the four values that actually matter:

```bash
if [ ! -f controller/.env ]; then
  cp controller/.env.example controller/.env
  chmod 600 controller/.env
fi
```

Ask the user (one question each, or as a single bundle):

- `NAVIDROME_URL` — e.g. `http://navidrome.local:4533`
- `NAVIDROME_USER`, `NAVIDROME_PASS`
- (Ollama server URL + model are set in the admin Settings UI, not via env)

Then patch `controller/.env` in place with `sed`, keeping the rest of the file as-is. Do **not** echo passwords back to the chat.

#### F3 — Reachability pre-flight

Before booting, prove from the host that Navidrome and Ollama actually answer. This catches 90% of "why is the DJ silent?" before it happens.

```bash
# Read the values we just wrote
set -a; . controller/.env; set +a

# Navidrome (Subsonic ping)
curl -sf --max-time 5 \
  "$NAVIDROME_URL/rest/ping.view?u=$NAVIDROME_USER&p=$NAVIDROME_PASS&v=1.16.1&c=sub-wave&f=json" \
  | grep -q '"status":"ok"' && echo "navidrome: ok" || echo "navidrome: FAILED"

# Ollama
curl -sf --max-time 5 "$OLLAMA_URL/api/tags" >/dev/null \
  && echo "ollama: ok" || echo "ollama: FAILED"
```

If either fails, surface the failure with the URL it tried, and stop. The stack will boot regardless but the radio will be silent — better to fix it now.

#### F4 — Run setup.sh

`scripts/setup.sh` is the canonical bootstrapper. Idempotent — re-running is safe and won't overwrite an existing `docker/.env` or `controller/.env`. It:

- Creates `STATE_DIR` subdirs (`voice/`, `archive/`, `jingles/`, `logs/`) world-writable (containers run as mixed UIDs)
- Generates `docker/.env` with three random Icecast passwords if missing
- Syncs `ICECAST_SOURCE_PASSWORD` between `docker/.env` and `controller/.env`
- Renders `state/icecast.xml` from the template
- Renders `state/emergency.mp3` (30s pink-noise fallback) and `state/bed.mp3` (60s studio bed) via ffmpeg
- Touches `auto.m3u` and `jingles.m3u` so Liquidsoap's `reload_mode="watch"` has something to watch

Both dev and prod default `STATE_DIR` to `<repo>/state` — repo-local, no sudo needed. An operator can still point it elsewhere (e.g. a dedicated data disk) by exporting `STATE_DIR`; if that target is outside `$HOME` the script will need sudo to write it — surface that, don't run sudo without asking.

```bash
# Default (dev or prod) — state in <repo>/state:
./scripts/setup.sh

# Only if relocating state to a path outside $HOME:
sudo STATE_DIR=/srv/subwave ./scripts/setup.sh
```

#### F5 — Boot the stack and generate jingles

```bash
# Prod (single host with Caddy)
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build

# OR Dev (no web container, no Caddy — runs npm run dev separately)
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d --build
```

First boot will spend a minute or two pulling images and compiling. Once `controller` reports ready, generate the station idents:

```bash
./scripts/generate-jingles.sh
```

This `docker compose exec`s into the controller and uses Piper to render the default set of station IDs into `${STATE_DIR}/jingles/`, then writes a fresh `jingles.m3u`. Liquidsoap's playlist uses `reload_mode="watch"`, so the new renders are picked up without a restart.

After F5, fall through to **Step 5 — Verify** below.

---

### First-boot path — already configured, just not running

The state and env files exist (a previous setup ran, the operator brought the stack down deliberately or after a reboot). No bootstrapping needed; just `up` it.

#### B1 — Sanity-check before booting

```bash
docker info >/dev/null  # daemon up?
[ -f docker/.env ] && [ -f controller/.env ]
# Derive STATE_DIR from docker/.env, not the bare compose fallback (see Step 0).
STATE_DIR=$(grep -E '^STATE_DIR=' docker/.env 2>/dev/null | cut -d= -f2- | tr -d '"')
STATE_DIR=${STATE_DIR:-state}
[ -f "$STATE_DIR/icecast.xml" ]
```

If any of those are missing, fall back to the initial-setup path — something was wiped.

#### B2 — Up

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
```

`--build` is cheap when nothing changed (BuildKit short-circuits via cache). Including it covers the case where the operator's been editing source between sessions.

#### B3 — Jingles

```bash
# STATE_DIR derived from docker/.env (see Step 0).
STATE_DIR=$(grep -E '^STATE_DIR=' docker/.env 2>/dev/null | cut -d= -f2- | tr -d '"')
STATE_DIR=${STATE_DIR:-state}
[ -s "$STATE_DIR/jingles.m3u" ] || ./scripts/generate-jingles.sh
```

Only re-render if the M3U is empty. Re-rendering when it isn't is harmless but slow.

Fall through to **Step 5 — Verify**.

---

### Update path — stack is running

This is the everyday case. Steps 1 through 6 below are the deploy workflow.

### Step 1 — Locate the repo and detect the stack

```bash
cd "$REPO"

# Which compose file is live? Whichever has containers up.
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.prod.yml ps
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml      ps
```

For the rest of this skill, `COMPOSE` means whichever file is live. Almost always `docker/docker-compose.prod.yml`.

### Step 2 — See what's incoming

```bash
git fetch
git status -sb                          # branch tracking + dirty files
git log HEAD..@{u} --oneline            # commits about to be pulled
git diff --name-only HEAD..@{u}         # files about to change
```

- Local clean and zero incoming commits → skip to Step 5 (verify only).
- Uncommitted local changes → `git status` will show them. Don't `git pull` blindly over them. Surface to the user and ask whether to stash, commit, or abort.
- Diverged history (local ahead AND behind) → pause and ask; don't auto-merge or rebase.

### Step 3 — Map changed files to services

Run through the diff and bucket files into actions. Mapping table (paths are relative to repo root):

| Changed path                              | Action                                    |
|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `controller/src/**`                       | rebuild + recreate `controller`           |
| `controller/Dockerfile*`                  | rebuild + recreate `controller`           |
| `controller/package*.json`                | rebuild + recreate `controller`           |
| `liquidsoap/radio.liq`                    | `docker compose ... restart liquidsoap` — radio.liq is bind-mounted in both compose files, no rebuild needed |
| `liquidsoap/Dockerfile*`                  | rebuild + recreate `liquidsoap`           |
| `web/**` (prod stack)                     | rebuild + recreate `web`                  |
| `web/**` (dev stack, separate `npm run dev`) | no docker action — hot-reloads in user's terminal |
| `docker/Caddyfile`                        | `docker compose ... restart caddy` (no rebuild — Caddy reloads from mount) |
| `docker/docker-compose*.yml`              | `docker compose ... up -d` (compose re-applies; will only recreate what diff-affected services) |
| `docker/icecast.xml*` or its template     | re-run `scripts/setup.sh` to re-render `state/icecast.xml`, then `up -d --force-recreate icecast` |
| `scripts/setup.sh`                        | safe to re-run (idempotent) — useful when state-dir layout changes |
| `scripts/**` (other), `state/**` (excluding code), `*.md`, `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.env.example`, `TODO.md` | no action needed |
| `.env` at repo root or `docker/.env`      | `docker compose ... up -d` to pick up new env values (compose detects env-changes and recreates affected services) |
| `controller/.env.example`                 | **does not** affect the running controller (it reads `controller/.env`, not the example). Surface as advisory; ask if the user wants to merge new keys into their `.env`. |

If the diff is empty after categorising (e.g. only README + TODO changed), the right answer is `git pull` and *no* docker action. Pull anyway so the working tree matches `origin` — it makes the next deploy faster.

### Step 4 — Pull, rebuild, recreate

```bash
git pull --ff-only
```

If `--ff-only` refuses (non-fast-forward), pause and ask — don't auto-rebase.

Then rebuild **only** the services from the mapping. Pass them all in one `up -d --build` call so compose orders them correctly:

```bash
# Example: controller and web both changed in prod stack
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build controller web
```

Do not use `docker compose restart` for code changes — it will appear to succeed and silently run the old code (see Fact #2).

If you only need to apply a config change (Caddyfile, compose YAML, env), prefer the minimal command:

```bash
# Caddyfile edited - Caddy reloads via mount, just bounce it
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.prod.yml restart caddy

# Compose YAML edited - let compose figure out what to recreate
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.prod.yml up -d

# Icecast template edited - re-render, then force-recreate icecast
./scripts/setup.sh
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --force-recreate icecast
```

### Step 5 — Verify

Run the bundled health-check script — it batches the canonical probes:

```bash
.claude/skills/subwave-deploy/scripts/health-check.sh
```

What healthy looks like:

- All five containers (`caddy`, `controller`, `icecast`, `liquidsoap`, `web` in prod; the dev subset otherwise) `Up` with no `(unhealthy)` or restarting.
- `GET /api/health` → `{"status":"on-air"}`.
- `GET /api/now-playing` → an object with `nowPlaying.title` and `nowPlaying.artist` populated (silence is a yellow flag, not necessarily failed — the stream may just be between tracks), `context.dominantMood` set, and a sane `weather` block.
- **The audio-level probe reports a non-silent `mean_volume`.** The script captures a few seconds of `/stream.mp3` and measures it with `ffmpeg volumedetect`. Real broadcast audio sits around −8 to −16 dB; a wedged/silent stream reads ~−91 dB. **This is the only check that proves the stream carries sound** — `/api/health` and byte flow do not (see Fact #4). If the probe says `SILENT`, the deploy is *not* done: `docker compose -f <COMPOSE> restart` to clear the wedged Liquidsoap source, then re-run the probe.
- No `error|fail|exception` lines in `docker compose logs --since 2m` for any service.

**Always end a deploy by confirming the audio-level probe is non-silent — not just that `/api/health` says `on-air`.** A green health endpoint over a silent stream is the exact production failure this skill exists to catch. If `health-check.sh` reports `SILENT` (or you're verifying by hand and a captured sample reads below ~−50 dB), restart the stack and probe again before reporting success.

Things that look like failure but aren't:
- `HEAD /stream.mp3` returns `400 Bad Request`. That's normal — Icecast only answers `GET`, not `HEAD`. Use `curl -sI` only to confirm the route exists; don't treat `400` as broken.
- Liquidsoap also gets recreated when you only asked for controller/web. That's compose dependency ordering, not a regression (see Fact #5).
- A few seconds of "Empty queue" or silence right after recreating Liquidsoap — the controller will re-feed `next.txt` on the next 1-second poll. (A *few seconds* — not a steady ~−91 dB. Persistent silence is the wedged-source bug in Fact #4, not this.)
- On a brand-new install: an empty `nowPlaying.title` for the first minute. The controller is still discovering the library and rendering the first DJ link. Wait one cycle (~10-30s).

If a container is restarting, fetch its last ~80 log lines and report the failure. Don't auto-recreate; the user wants to see the error, not a flapping container.

### Step 6 — Report back

Keep the summary tight. A good shape:

- **Setup mode**: what state was detected (fresh / configured-but-down / running) and what work was done (setup.sh ran, env seeded, X containers built, etc.). Skip this line entirely for routine updates.
- What was pulled (commit range or "already up to date").
- What was rebuilt (or "no rebuild needed").
- Health status: containers up + endpoint outputs + the live track / DJ name from `/api/now-playing` (this proves the full pipeline end-to-end, not just that the container is running).
- Any anomalies surfaced in the log scan or pre-flight (Navidrome/Ollama unreachable, missing prerequisites).

## When to pause and ask

Free to act on: prerequisite checks, `scripts/setup.sh` on a fresh checkout, `git fetch`, `git pull --ff-only`, `docker compose build`, `up -d`, `restart`, `logs`, `generate-jingles.sh`, all health probes, log scans.

**Confirm first** before any of these:

- Overwriting an existing `controller/.env` with a fresh seed from `.env.example` — the operator may already have working credentials in there.
- Echoing or logging Navidrome / Ollama passwords back to the chat at any point.
- Running `scripts/setup.sh` with `sudo` — surface the command, let the user run it themselves if they prefer.
- Auto-installing missing host prerequisites (docker, ffmpeg, etc.) via the package manager — that's a sudo-level decision and depends on the distro.
- `git pull` refusing fast-forward (merge/rebase needed) — diverged history is a human decision.
- Local uncommitted changes that would conflict with the pull.
- `docker compose down` of any kind, especially `down -v` (volumes wipe).
- Force-recreating the whole stack (`up -d --force-recreate` with no service argument).
- Removing or pruning `state/` contents — that directory carries the IPC files, voice WAVs, jingles, and the hourly archive. Losing it is a real loss.
- Removing named volumes or running `docker system prune`.
- Editing the live Caddyfile / compose / `.env` in place when the diff didn't ask for it.

## Helper

`scripts/health-check.sh` (relative to this skill folder) runs the standard probes and emits a compact report. It auto-detects which compose file is live and which host port Caddy is mapped to, so it works whether the user has Caddy on `:80` or `:4800`. It includes the **audio-level probe** — it captures a few seconds of `/stream.mp3` and fails (non-zero exit, `SILENT` line) if the mean volume is below ~−50 dB, catching the wedged-source silent-stream bug that `/api/health` cannot see. Needs `ffmpeg` on PATH; if absent, the probe is skipped with a warning rather than silently passing.

## Notes for working on the project (worth carrying forward)

- `radio.liq`'s `on_track_change` hook is attached to the `music` source, not to a downstream stage. If a deploy edits that hook to a different source, metadata fidelity drops — surface it as a yellow flag.
- The controller is the single writer of `next.txt` and `say.txt` (via `queue.serveNext()`). A diff that adds a second writer is a red flag.
- Voice WAV is written ~200 ms before the track URI; that ordering is load-bearing. A diff that reorders it is a red flag.
- Festivals in `controller/src/context.js` are operator-specific (Sikh/UK calendar). Mention but don't push back on edits there.
- `scripts/setup.sh` is idempotent and safe to re-run — useful when the icecast template or state-dir layout changes. It will *not* overwrite an existing `controller/.env` or `docker/.env`.
