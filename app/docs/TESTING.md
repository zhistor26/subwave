# Testing the SUB/WAVE app on iOS and Android

How to build, run, and test the Expo app on simulators/emulators, physical
devices, and via EAS cloud builds. Read the **Architecture-critical facts**
section first — one wrong toggle and playback crashes on launch.

---

## Architecture-critical facts (read before changing native config)

### Both platforms run the New Architecture — it's mandatory in RN 0.85

RN 0.82+ **removed the ability to opt out** of the New Architecture. Both
platforms run it ON, and this is required (Reanimated 4.3.1 only works under new
arch):

- **iOS** — `Info.plist RCTNewArchEnabled = true`, Pods built `-DRCT_NEW_ARCH_ENABLED=1`.
- **Android** — `android/gradle.properties` still has a leftover
  `newArchEnabled=false`, but **Gradle ignores it** and prints:
  `Setting newArchEnabled=false … is not supported anymore since React Native 0.82
  … The application will run with the New Architecture enabled by default.`
  The line is a harmless no-op; you can delete it.

`app.json` also still declares `newArchEnabled: false` — equally a no-op. Don't
rely on these flags; they do nothing on this RN version.

### Why `react-native-track-player` still works under new arch

RNTP 4.1.2 is not natively New-Architecture-compatible — out of the box, Android
playback crashes with `You should not use ReactNativeHost directly in the New
Architecture` from `MusicService`. **The fix is `patches/react-native-track-player+4.1.2.patch`**,
which makes two source edits:

- `MusicModule.kt` — routes async `@ReactMethod`s through a Unit-returning
  `launch` helper (TurboModule interop requires void-returning async methods).
- `MusicService.kt` — `currentReactContextCompat()` obtains the `ReactContext`
  from `ReactHost` (new arch) instead of the `ReactNativeHost.reactInstanceManager`
  path that throws, with an old-arch fallback.

> Do not delete this patch. Without it, Android RNTP crashes on the first
> playback event. iOS (SwiftAudioEx path) is unaffected by the crash but the
> patch is harmless there. Validated: Android `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` and iOS live
> playback both with the patch applied.

### Other load-bearing facts

- **Expo Go does not work** — native modules (RNTP, Skia, Reanimated worklets)
  ship compiled code. You must build a **dev client**.
- **Stream is MP3 only** (`{base}/stream.mp3`), same universal-floor choice as
  the web player. No Opus/Ogg.
- **No backend needed for testing** — the app defaults to the public
  `getsubwave.com` station, which is live. Onboarding pre-fills it.
- **Base URL is fully runtime** — there are no hardcoded station URLs in source.
  All API/stream URLs come from `StationContext` → `createApi(baseUrl)`.

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Needed for | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Node 20+ / npm | everything | `npm install` (uses `legacy-peer-deps`, set in `.npmrc`) |
| Xcode 16+ + CocoaPods | iOS sim/device | `xcode-select --install`, `sudo gem install cocoapods` |
| **JDK 17** | Android build | `brew install openjdk@17`. **Not** JDK 21 (Android Studio's JBR) — it fails the Gradle build with a JVM-target mismatch. |
| Android SDK + an AVD | Android emulator | via Android Studio; emulator binary at `$ANDROID_HOME/emulator` |

First-time setup:

```bash
cd app
npm install        # postinstall applies patches/ via patch-package
```

---

## Local testing — iOS simulator

The fast inner loop. No Apple Developer account required.

```bash
cd app

# Build, install, and launch on a booted simulator.
# (Boot one first via: open -a Simulator)
npx expo run:ios

# If run:ios skips the dev server (non-interactive shells do), start Metro
# yourself and open the installed app pointed at localhost:
npx expo start --dev-client --port 8081 &
xcrun simctl openurl <SIM_UDID> \
  "exp+subwave://expo-development-client/?url=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8081"
```

**Use `localhost`, not the LAN IP**, in the deep link for simulators — the LAN
IP can time out (`xcrun simctl openurl ... code: 60`).

**Verified working** (2026-06): builds clean (0 errors), bundles 4075 modules,
renders onboarding → health check (all 4 probes OK against live getsubwave.com)
→ player with live audio (NOW PLAYING timer advances), runtime theming, cover
art, and the Skia spectrum.

---

## Local testing — Android emulator

```bash
cd app

# Boot an AVD (list them: $ANDROID_HOME/emulator/emulator -list-avds)
$ANDROID_HOME/emulator/emulator -avd <AVD_NAME> &

# Build with JDK 17 — single connected emulator is auto-selected.
# DO NOT pass `--device <adb-serial>`; expo wants an AVD name, not emulator-5554.
JAVA_HOME=/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@17 npx expo run:android
```

If the dev client opens against the LAN IP and can't reach Metro, set the
reverse tunnel and relaunch via localhost:

```bash
adb reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081
adb shell am start -a android.intent.action.VIEW \
  -d "exp+subwave://expo-development-client/?url=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8081" \
  com.getsubwave.app
adb exec-out screencap -p > /tmp/screen.png   # always screenshot to verify
```

**Verified working** (2026-06): `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` with JDK 17 (new arch ON, via
the RNTP patch), debug APK installed on the emulator. (Physical-device run is
covered and proven by the `subwave-app-android` skill — see below.)

---

## Physical devices

### Android phone — use the `subwave-app-android` skill

The repo ships a skill (`.claude/skills/subwave-app-android/`) that automates
getting the app onto a connected Pixel, in two modes:

- **Dev / USB** — dev-client app loads live JS from Metro over `adb reverse`;
  hot-reload while tethered.
- **Release / embedded** — self-contained release APK (`./gradlew assembleRelease`
  with **JDK 17**) that runs unplugged over WiFi/cellular.

It handles the JDK-17 gotcha, the Metro tunnel, the deep link, and screenshots
to verify. The release APK is signed with the **debug keystore** — fine for
sideloading, **not** for Play Store.

### iOS device

Two options:
1. **Local** — open `ios/SUBWAVE.xcworkspace` in Xcode, select your device,
   set a development team (Signing & Capabilities), run. Needs a free or paid
   Apple ID for on-device signing.
2. **EAS** — `eas build --profile development-device --platform ios` (see below).

Background audio (lock screen / CarPlay / headphones) and metadata can only be
properly judged on a **physical device** — the remote-control wiring lives in
`service.ts` (Play/Pause/Stop; Next/Seek intentionally omitted for a live
stream).

---

## EAS cloud builds (for distributing to testers)

Use EAS when testers can't build locally — TestFlight (iOS) or a shareable
internal APK (Android). `eas.json` already defines the profiles; what's missing
is **account linking and auth**, which are interactive and must be done by the
project owner.

### One-time setup (owner runs these)

```bash
npm i -g eas-cli
eas login                 # your Expo account
cd app
eas init                  # links the project: writes owner + extra.eas.projectId
                          # into app.json (currently absent)
```

`eas.json` uses `appVersionSource: remote`, so build/version numbers are managed
on the EAS servers (`production` auto-increments) — you don't hand-edit
`ios.buildNumber` / `android.versionCode`.

### Build profiles (already configured in `eas.json`)

| Profile | Output | Account needs |
|---|---|---|
| `development` | dev client, iOS **simulator** | EAS only |
| `development-device` | dev client, physical device | iOS: Apple Developer ($99/yr) for device provisioning |
| `preview` | internal: Android **APK**, iOS non-simulator | Android: none (EAS-managed keystore). iOS: Apple Developer |
| `production` | store builds, auto-incremented | Apple Developer + Play Console |

### Example: shareable Android APK for testers (no Apple account)

```bash
eas build --profile preview --platform android
# EAS returns a URL; testers download + sideload the APK.
```

### Example: iOS TestFlight

```bash
eas build --profile production --platform ios     # needs Apple Developer
eas submit --profile production --platform ios     # uploads to App Store Connect
```

> **Note:** there is no `expo-updates` dependency installed, so OTA / EAS Update
> is not wired up. Every JS change requires a new build (or local Metro). Add
> `expo-updates` + a `channel` per profile if you want OTA later.

## Known issues / gotchas

- **`patches/react-native-track-player+4.1.2.patch`** is the RNTP new-arch fix
  (2 source files — see "Architecture-critical facts"). It was previously bloated
  to 229 files with accidental Gradle build artifacts; **slimmed to just the 2
  `.kt` source files** (2026-06) and re-verified with a clean `BUILD SUCCESSFUL`.
  Keep it lean — never run `patch-package` after a Gradle build has populated
  `node_modules/react-native-track-player/android/build/`, or it recaptures the
  junk.
- **JDK 21 fails the Android build.** Always `JAVA_HOME=/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@17`.
- **`LegacySurfaceTexture is not attached!`** in Android logcat is **noise** from
  the Skia visualizer surface, not a crash.
- **Gradle is pinned to 8.14.3** via `plugins/withGradleVersion.js` — RN's
  bundled Gradle plugins reference an API removed in Gradle 9.
- **`expo run:ios` non-interactively prints "Skipping dev server"** and then
  fails the final deep-link open — the build/install still succeeded; just start
  Metro and open via `localhost` (above).
